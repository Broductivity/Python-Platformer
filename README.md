# Python-Platformer-Finished
A Python platformer complete with graphics, traps, blocks, scrolling, jumping, and double-jumping.
Use the left and right arrow keys or a and d to move. Press the up arrow key or space to jump. Press 1, 2, 3, and 4 to switch characters.
I used TechWithTim's Python-Platformer assets (https://github.com/techwithtim/Python-Platformer) and the code he did on a tutorial on FreeCodeCamp's channel (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gLeplbqtqg).
