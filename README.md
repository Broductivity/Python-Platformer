# Python-Platformer-Finished
A Python platformer complete with graphics, traps, blocks, scrolling, jumping, and double-jumping. It also has a flag that is collectable.
Use the left and right arrow keys or A and D to move. Press the up arrow key or space to jump. Press 1, 2, 3, and 4 to switch characters.
I used TechWithTim's Python-Platformer assets (https://github.com/techwithtim/Python-Platformer) and the code he did on a tutorial on FreeCodeCamp's channel (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gLeplbqtqg). I made a few edits such as character switching, a collectable flag, up arrow jumping, and A and D key movement.

**Note:** Make ***SURE*** you have an 'assets' folder where you store the Audio, Background, Checkpoints, Fire, MainCharacters, Terrain, and Traps folders. Also, make sure you have moved the file 'Roa - Pixel Story.mp3' outside the 'assets' folder and into the main project folder that will be created when you download this project.
